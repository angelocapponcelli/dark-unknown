-For tiles with 2 tiles or more in height (such as walls and cliffs), in order to 
autotiling work, you must turn off the "Autotile while drawing" and use
the shortcut (ctrl + m on windows) AFTER drawing. 

-The baluster2 autotile (the one that is aligned with the edge of the wall), must be 
drawn 'outside' of the ground(the side which the wall below is facing). Open the 
Tiled Map Editor example to see what I mean or watch the video(starting at 08:39) provided 
on my itch page (https://rafaelmatos.itch.io/epic-rpg-world-asset-pack-crypt)

Tip: If you find youself trying to connect sections that are already completed 
with the autotile and you can't undone it, delete only the tiles that comes after 
the autotile is done and start drawing again to connect both sections.

in need for help, reach me on Itch or on my Twitter @RafaRPM.
